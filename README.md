+ [Recent Experience](#recent-experience): Recent work-related experience in Data Science.
+ [Personal Projects](#personal-projects): Toy projects to showcase techniques and problem solving.
+ [Master's Projects](#masters-projects): Collaborative and personal projects from Applied Data Science Master's at University of Michigan.

## Recent Experience

### Focus for Democracy

+ Led full-cycle data projects to optimize engagement and strategy at nonprofit, from cleaning and validation to modeling.
+ Engineered reusable SQL and Python data pipelines to automate processes and enable rapid analysis for time-sensitive decisions.
+ Designed and implemented A/B testing to evaluate outreach effectiveness, increasing engagement by 27%.
+ Conducted EDA and statistical analysis and presented actionable insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


## Personal Projects

### Library of Congress Project. 

APIs | Similarity Metrics | EDA | Visualizations

This projects grew out of a collaborative Alternative Spring Break project with the Library of Congress. I wanted to dig into the data more, and create a new way of visualizing search results in a new way using cosine similarity to group search results in relation to their focus. 

+ Used SVM and cosine similarity to compare user queries to returned LOC items
+ Used Spacy and other NLP to process user queries
+ Built customized visualizations with Altair
+ Worked with LOC API to create dynamic search results

## Master's Projects

### Capstone Project: National Park LLM-based Chatbot

Generative AI | LLM | NLP | Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Gaussian NB | tf-idf | LangChain

+ Developed and evaluated an LLM-based chatbot system leveraging real-time API integration and retrieval-augmented generation.
+ Trained and evaluated multiple models (NLP models and OpenAI-based LLM) to parse user input into structured API calls.
+ Used LangChain and LangGraph to assess model quality, improving retrieval accuracy and data consistency for RAG pipelines.

### Milestone II: Predicting Natural Gas Consumption

KNN Clustering | Time Series | Gaussian Naive Bayes | Random Forest | Geospatial Data | Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning

+ Collaborated with 2 other students to create natural gas consumption predictive models including Random Forest, KNN, and GNB. 
+ Created, trained, and evaluated models combining time series data with NOAA data and unsupervised clustering results as features.
+ Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and understand modeling results to help improve future strategy.

### Milestone I: Effect of Sea Lever Rise on Mortgage Prices

Geopandas | Geospatial Data | Data Analysis | Data Cleaning

A look at the effect of Sea Level Rise on Mortgage prices compared to FEMA high risk zones in Coastal census tracts.

+ Collaborated with 2 other students on a data analysis project exploring the effect of Sea Level Rise by looking at Mortgage prices comparisons for FEMA high risk zones and Coastal census tracts.
+ Conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on geospatial sea level rise data.
+ Worked with geospatial data and geopandas to create data visualizations and choropleth maps based on different sea level rise scenarios, and categorizing census tracts as coastal and FEMA risk zones for ensuing mortgage price comparisons.
